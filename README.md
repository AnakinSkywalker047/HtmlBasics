        <p>Albert Einstein ( 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).
            His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence <strong>formula E = mc2</strong> <!-- bold text-->, which has been dubbed <em>"the world's most famous equation"</em>.
            He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics <em>"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"</em> <!-- italic text--> a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>

           <p>The son of a salesman who later operated an electrochemical factory.       <!-- open Paragraph tag-->
            Einstein was born in the German Empire but moved to Switzerland in 1895 and renounced his German citizenship in 1896. 
            Specializing in physics and mathematics, he received his academic teaching diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich in 1900. 
            The following year, he acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept for his entire life.
            After initially struggling to find work, from 1902 to 1909 he was employed as a patent examiner at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern.</p> <!-- close Paragraph tag-->
            
            <p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. 
            This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office. 
            In 1905, called his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which attracted the attention of the academic world; 
            the first outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, 
            the second paper explained Brownian motion,
            the third paper introduced special relativity, 
            and the fourth mass-energy equivalence. 
            That year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich.
